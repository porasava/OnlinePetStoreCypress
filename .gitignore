error: src refspec main does not match any
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/porasava/CompareAutomationtesttools.git'
This error message typically indicates that there are no commits on the "main" branch of your local repository, so Git is unable to push any changes to the remote repository.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

Make sure that you have committed your changes to your local repository using the following command:
sql
Copy code
git commit -m "commit message"
Ensure that your local repository is up-to-date with the remote repository using the following command:
css
Copy code
git pull origin main
Check the branch name you are currently on by using the following command:
Copy code
git branch
If you are not currently on the "main" branch, switch to the "main" branch using the following command:
css
Copy code
git checkout main
Finally, try to push your changes to the remote repository using the following command:
css
Copy code
git push origin main
If the issue still persists, you may want to check if you have the correct repository URL set up and if you have the necessary permissions to push changes to the remote repository.
