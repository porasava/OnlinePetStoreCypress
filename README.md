#### Project Overview
In this project, I have developed automated test scripts using Cypress for an online pet store. These tests aim to ensure the functionality of the shopping website. The project showcases the practical application of Cypress for end-to-end testing.


#### Technologies Used
Development Tools: Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, SQL Server Management Studio
Testing Framework: Cypress
Server: Windows Server

#### Languages
Programming Languages: C#, CSS, HTML, JavaScript


#### Test Scenarios
The project includes various test scenarios covering different aspects of the online pet store, including:

User registration and login
Customer registration and login
Adding/deleting products from the product list
Browsing and searching for pet products
Adding products to the shopping cart
Checkout processing

These test scenarios demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of Cypress in ensuring the quality of web applications.


#### Getting Started
Before running the tests, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
Clone this repository
deploy C# shopping website to IIS window server 
Install Node.js
Install project dependencies using npm install


#### How to Run Tests
To execute the Cypress tests, use the following command:
  npx cypress open
  node_modules/.bin/cypress run --headed

Cypress will open a test runner that allows you to interactively run and debug the tests.
